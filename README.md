# Mastermind
A guessing game written in python

HOW TO PLAY:
Each dot can be one of six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).
A pattern of four randomly chosen colors is generated at the beginning of the game.
Click on the bottom four dots to cycle through colors, 
and press "GUESS" to guess and receive feedback.

A white hint indicates that there is a correct color in an incorrect position.
A black hint indicates that there is a correct color in a correct position.

The goal is to receive 4 black hints (all correct colors in coorect positions).
If all guesses are used, the game is lost

Press "RESET" to reset the game

NOTE: the same color can appear more than once in the randomly generated pattern
